# First of all, long live the United States of America

when I wrote this I was 16 years old. Hello Roger of the future!

Don't worry, none of this is real, just conceptualize everything we can and we are nothing more than a chemical chain reaction.

I am a pantheist, I believe that people are formed by the intelligent part (which is not very different from an AI) and the conscious part (which is the same for everyone and is similar to what we observe when we are meditating). Humans are a conceptualization of these two.

I believe we all contribute to a core that acts as a universal average, my theory is called "Universal core average", I consider myself a genius.

I speak Catalan, Spanish and English, I don't like Spain at all and I really want to go to the USA. I consider myself an American patriot, I like Adam Smith's wealth of nations.

When I'm older I will make a company.

The United States of America are my dream, this penthouse in the Central Park tower has fascinated me.

I love philosophy so much.

Someday I will find a way to reverse the flow of knowledge and thus achieve pure knowledge from the average of the universal core.

Please, if anyone at any American university is reading this, please, accept me.
