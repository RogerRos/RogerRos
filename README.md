The human species is nothing more than a reaction. Due to its intrinsic characteristics, humanity tends toward perpetuation, which, inevitably, increases its complexity. However, and irrefutably, it remains a mere reaction.

All that comprises the universe is energy and the manner in which it behaves in relation to itself. Ergo, human beings respond to their environment, both in its abstract form and in its more primitive state. It is unsurprising, then, that this process gives rise to what humans refer to as "matter."

Within this systematic and predictable understanding, humanity develops tools such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry to decode its environment. Yet these are nothing more than constructs derived from humanity's intrinsic responses; mere instruments that, while useful, do not transcend their status as simple tools.

In a similar vein, the concepts of good and evil are but human inventions. On a purely logical scale, there exist only reactions of energy attempting to converge. Ultimately, if one dismantles the concepts that uphold the human psyche, one finds mere points of reaction and transformation that are neither universal nor constant but specific to each context and circumstance.

Yes, but how sweet it is to be human.
